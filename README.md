# handcrafted_multiclass

Handcrafted algorithms produced for a multi-class classification problem with tf-idf scores as attributes

The below algorithms were built:
* K Nearest Neighbours
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Ensemble (Hard Vote)

Other features include:
* SVD dimensionality reduction
* Training using 90/10 hold out
* Evaluation with confusion matrix metrics
